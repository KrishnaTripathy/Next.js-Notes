Handling Errors in Layouts

-An error.tsx file will handle errors for all its nested  child segements

- The error boundary does not catch errors thrown here because it's nested inside the layouts component.

- copy the error.tsx from [reviewFolder] and paste it in [productId] folder.

- copy the randomeFunction generation from [reviewId] folder page.tsx
- and paste it from [productId] folder layout.tsx and edit it.
- move error.tsx from [productId ] folder to product folder.
