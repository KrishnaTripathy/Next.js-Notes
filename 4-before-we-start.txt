1. React server Component

React server component is a new architacture introduced by the react team in version 18 which was quickly embraced by Next.js
The architacture introduces a new way of creating React components , splitting them into 2 types: 

- server components
- Client components


server components : In Next.js, all components are server components by default 
                    They have the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database.
                    However, they don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions.

Client Components : To create a Client component, it's necessary to add "use client" at the top of the component files
                    Client components can't perform tasks like reading files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions.
