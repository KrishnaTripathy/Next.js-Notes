actively loading content.

loading.tsx Benefits

1. You can display the loading state as soon as a user navigatesnto a new route.
The immediate feedback reassures users that their actions has been acknowledged, reduces perceived loading times, and makes the application feel more responsive.

2. Next.js allows the creation of shared layouts that remain interactive while new route segments are loading.
that means, Users can continue interacting with certain parts of the application, such as a navigation menu or sidebar,
even if the main content is still being fetched.
