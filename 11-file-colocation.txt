File Colocation 

create dashboard folder inside app folder and inside dashboard folder create line-chart.tsx
http://localhost:3000/dashboard : showing undefined because the dashboard route isn't publicly accessible until a page.tsx file is defined.
moreover only the route becomes publicly accessible only the content returned by page.
Tsx is sent to the client the content returned must be a default exported react component.
so if we define react component page.tsx function barChart without exporting it as the default , on 
revisiting the browser we can see the 404 page will no longer be displayed instead we encounter an error the
default export is not a react component in page /dashboard .
