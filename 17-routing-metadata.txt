Routing Metadata

Ensuring proper search engine optimization(SEO) is a crucial for increasing visibility and attracting users.

Next.js introduced the Metadata API which allows you to define metadata for each page.

Metadata ensures accurate and relevant info is displayed when your pages are shared or indexed.


Configuring Metadata

Export a static metadata object.
export a dynamic generateMetadata function

Metadata rules :

both layout.tsx and page.tsx files can export metadata. If defined in a layout, it 
applies to all pages in that layout, but if defined in a page, it applies only to that page.

Metadata is read in order, from the root level down to the final page level.

when there's metedata in multiple places for the same route, they get combined.
but page metadata will replace layout metadata if they have the same properties.


1. static metadata constant 

2. Dynamic metadata

- you can not export both the metadata object and the generate metadata function from the same route segment.
