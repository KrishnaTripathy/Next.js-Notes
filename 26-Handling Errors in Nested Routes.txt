Handling Errors in Nested Routes

- Errors bubble up to the closest parent error boundary.
- An error.tsx file will cater to errors for all its nested child segemnts.
- By positioning error.tsx files at different levels in the nested floders of a route, you
can achieve a  more granular level of error handling.

- move the error.tsx file form products folder.
