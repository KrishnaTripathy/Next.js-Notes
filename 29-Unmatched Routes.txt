Unmatched Routes

Sub-navigation in routes 

- add Link in the @notifications folder page.tsx file.
- within the @notifications folder create archived folder and within the folder create page.tsx.


Navigation from the UI 

- In the case of navigation within the UI, Next.js retains the previously active state of 
a slot regardless of changes in the URL.

Page reload

- Next.js immediately searches for a default.tsx file with in each unmatched slot.
- The presence of this file is critical, as it provides the default content that Next.js will render in the user interface.
-If this default.tsx file is missing in any of the unmatched slots for the current route, Next.js will render a 404 error.


default.tsx

- The `default.tsx` file in Next.js serves as a fallback to render content when the 
framework can not retrive a slot's active state from the current URL.

- You have complete freedom to define the UI for unmatched routes: you can either mirror the content
found in page.tsx or craft an entirely custom view.

- create a default.tsx file within the complex-dashboard folder.
- create a default.tsx file within the @users folder.
- create a default.tsx file within the @revenue folder.
