Routing 

Next.js has a file system based routing mechanism.

URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase.


ue the command : npx create-next-app@latest routing-demo


Routing Conventions

All routes must be placed inside the app folders
every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx

every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL 


File based Routing

Scenario 1 : localhost:3000
 create a new folder under src. named as app folder here we create a page.tsx file. .tsx is a extension.

 npm run dev for running the page 


 Scenario 2 : user render about page and another render profile page.
              in app folder we have create another about folder here we create page.tsx file. eg: localhost:3000/about
              and another folder profile create in the app folder and create a page.tsx file in the profile folder. eg: localhost:3000/profile
              routes are associated with a file based on the containing folders name within the app folder.
              localhost:3000/dashboard : page not found
