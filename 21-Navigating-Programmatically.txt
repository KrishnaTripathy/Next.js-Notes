Navigating Programmatically 

specifically you are order an item from amazon and its shows place order 
and after that it redirect to /confirm page section successfully placed.

when we place the place order button it will navigate to home page.

create a folder order-product folder inside app folder and inside order-product folder create page.tsx file.
useRouter only work on client component.
so we have used "use client"; in this page.
