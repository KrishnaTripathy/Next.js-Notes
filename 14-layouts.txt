Layouts

A page is UI  that is unique to a route 
A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages in the app
e.g. Header , content , footer.

How to Create Layouts
you can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a layout.js or layout.tsx file.
That component should accept a children prop that will be populated with a child page during rendering.

layout.tsx is the top-most layout or root layout is a mandatory layout for every nextjs.
layout.tsx file automatically generated if you deleted the file .

the page.tsx will replace this children prop when the layout is rendered in the browser.
the children prop here represents our  home component defined in page.tsx. which contains the H1 welcome home.
